# Advent Of Code (2020) Haskell Solutions

My randomly generated puzzle input can be found in [root/input](https://github.com/nsglover/AdventOfCode2018/blob/master/input/). Replace with your own randomly generated input and run `runhaskell Main.hs` to see the solutions to all 25 puzzles. To solve one puzzle, run `ghc Main.hs -e "solve True i"` for any day `i` (1 to 25) (use `False` instead if you do not want to see computation times).

The library [Hint](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint) is required for the above commands. If you do not have Hint installed, you can solve puzzles by calling their `part1` and `part2` functions respectively on a `Solution` instance (see [root/Common/Solution.hs](https://github.com/nsglover/AdventOfCode2018/blob/master/Common/Solution.hs)) and manually supplying the puzzle input.
